Actually i am in emergency so i can't able to write correct solution. But I will try my best and i know this is 70 to 80% correct solution. Please Go through that.



Steps :====>

To apply the super trend indicator to generate a signal on each 5 minute candle, you can use the following steps:

Calculate the average true range (ATR) for the past 7 periods (in this case, 5 minute candles). The ATR is a measure of volatility,
 and it is used to determine the stop loss and take profit levels for the super trend indicator.

Calculate the basic upper band and lower band using the following formulas:

Upper Band = (Highest high of the past 7 periods) + (MULTIPLIER * ATR)
Lower Band = (Lowest low of the past 7 periods) - (MULTIPLIER * ATR)
Determine the super trend direction based on the current close price and the upper and lower bands. 
If the current close price is above the upper band, the super trend is up (long signal). 
If the current close price is below the lower band, the super trend is down (short signal).

If the super trend direction changes from the previous period, adjust the upper and lower bands using the following formulas:

If the super trend changes from down to up (long signal):
Upper Band = (Highest high of the past 7 periods) + (MULTIPLIER * ATR)
Lower Band = (Current close price) - (MULTIPLIER * ATR)
If the super trend changes from up to down (short signal):
Upper Band = (Current close price) + (MULTIPLIER * ATR)
Lower Band = (Lowest low of the past 7 periods) - (MULTIPLIER * ATR)
Repeat these steps for each subsequent 5 minute candle until you want to stop generating signals.
It's important to note that the super trend indicator is a trend following indicator, and it works best in trending markets. 
It may not be as effective in ranging or choppy markets
